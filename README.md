Fusion Invoice
=============

Self Hosted Online Invoicing for Freelancers and Small Businesses
------------------------

This repository was created to hopefully track and better such a great piece of software.
If you would like to download an 'Official Release' from the original developer you can do so here: http://fusioninvoice.com

I created this repo since the original creator did not want 'Collaboration' on this project.  Well being that the project is
opensource and the license allows me to do this why not?

If you would like to commit to the master branch of this project feel free to let me know.
